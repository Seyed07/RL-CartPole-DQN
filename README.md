# RL-CartPole-DQN
Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for solving the CartPole-v1 environment using Reinforcement Learning. The agent learns to balance a pole on a cart through trial and error. Includes TensorFlow-based DQN model, reward visualization, and a real-time simulation with "human-render" mode. Perfect for learning RL basics.
